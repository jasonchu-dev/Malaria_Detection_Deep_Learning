# Malaria Detection

Deep learning/software engineering project using TensorFlow and Streamlit. Prompts user for malaria image sample. Use model to make prediction. Tell user whether malaria is detected or not.

## To run
Python needed, then run
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Unzip Dataset.zip and model.zip

Bigger dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria/download?datasetVersionNumber=1) can used on hardware acceleration if there is one.

Then run
```
    streamlit run app.py
```
